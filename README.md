# Captcha Solver Application This is a simple, single-file web application designed to demonstrate a basic captcha solving interface. It displays a captcha image and allows the user to input the perceived text, providing immediate feedback. ## Features - **Captcha Display**: Shows an image which is either a default `sample.png` or an image specified via a URL parameter. - **User Input**: An input field for entering the captcha text. - **Submission & Validation**: A button to submit the text and client-side validation against a hardcoded answer. - **Responsive Design**: Built with Tailwind CSS for a modern, mobile-friendly interface. - **URL Parameter Support**: Dynamically loads captcha images if a `?url=` parameter is provided in the browser's address bar. ## How to Use 1. **Open `index.html`**: Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser. 2. **Default Captcha**: By default, the application will display the `sample.png` image. 3. **Custom Captcha**: To load a different image, append a `?url=` query parameter to the URL in your browser's address bar. For example: `file:///path/to/your/index.html?url=https://example.com/some-other-captcha.png` (Note: Due to CORS restrictions, fetching images from different domains might be blocked if the server doesn't allow it. For local testing, ensure your image is served from a permissive source or locally.) 4. **Enter Solution**: Type the text you see in the captcha image into the input field. For the default `sample.png`, the correct answer is `ADCRS`. 5. **Submit**: Click the "Submit" button or press `Enter` to check your answer. The application will provide feedback below the button. ## Technologies Used - **HTML5**: For structuring the web page. - **Tailwind CSS**: For styling and responsive design. - **JavaScript**: For dynamic image loading, input handling, and client-side captcha validation. ## Development To run this application, no special server setup is required. Just open `index.html` directly in any modern web browser. ## License This project is open-sourced under the MIT License. See the `LICENSE` file for more details.
